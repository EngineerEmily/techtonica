			<p>For the over 5 years, I worked at a children's museum in downtown San Jose. I started there as a volunteer, then an intern. I was then hired into the membership department, then the marketing department and then finally in a special events department where we brought together scientists, tech companies, and community members to come up with ideas and solutions to problems in our area. Outside of work, I do a lot of volunteer work particularly advocating for affordable housing, campaign finance reform, and open data in local government. I also work on getting more young people involved in politics and I'm the treasurer of my local historical association. I helped them update their membership system to allow online membership sign ups and payment. I thrive on finding technology solutions to help the local community.</p>
			<p>I had always wanted to be an engineer. In high school, my favorite activity with friends was building websites. There wasn't a programming class, so I was the TA for the computer department, where they showed me how to ghost the school computers and install hardware. I went to the California Maritime Academy, where I received a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. At Cal Maritime, I mostly learned how to work on engines on ships, but I thrived most at programming. We learned MATLAB for our programming needs. I attempted to teach myself more coding, especially using languages that are more accessible. I joined a small group called Girl Develop It (San Jose). They helped me learn more about GitHub and Foundation. I try to learn what I can based on the projects of things I want to get done. I joined a local civic hacker brigade called Code for San Jose.</p>
			<p>After I graduated from college, I deviated from a technical career because I didn't have the confidence to pursue it. I want to pivot back. It seems to be a game of catch up and I'm still lost on where to start. I want to understand what those job postings are saying when they are asking for a front-end, back-end, or full stack developer. I want to know how to use APIs and JSONs for open data projects. In these five years, I want to be gainfully employed as a programmer, I want to create and contribute open source projects, and I want to use my ability to program to help my community. Techtonica can help by providing the training, living stipend, and follow through on job placement.</p>
